# Employee Tracker

  ## Description

  The Employee Tracker is a command-line application designed to help businesses manage and organize employee information efficiently. This application provides a way to add, view, update, and delete employee records, ensuring that HR and management teams have easy access to essential data. It is built using Node.js, MySQL, and JavaScript, offering an intuitive and seamless way to interact with employee data through a simple interface.This tool allows administrators to manage their employees by interacting with different tables in a MySQL database, including details like employee roles, departments, and salaries. It ensures that employee information is consistently updated and organized in real-time, making it easier to track and manage the workforce.

  

  - Motivation: The primary motivation for this project was to improve my SQL skills. As a software developer, being proficient in database management is crucial, and I wanted to challenge myself to strengthen my knowledge and experience with SQL. I aimed to deepen my understanding of key concepts such as relational database design, writing complex queries, and optimizing database performance.Through this project, I focused on using SQL as the core of the application. By building an Employee Tracker with a backend powered by MySQL, I gained hands-on experience in creating tables, defining relationships between them, and crafting SQL queries to efficiently manage and retrieve employee data. This allowed me to improve my ability to handle data-driven applications while ensuring that I could optimize queries for better performance.
  - Reason: I built this project to further develop my skills in backend development and database management. I wanted to challenge myself by creating an application that required managing complex data relationships, and I saw this as an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with SQL and relational databases.
  - Problem Solved: The Employee Tracker project solves the problem of efficiently managing and organizing employee data within a company. In larger organizations, manually keeping track of employees, their roles, departments, and managers can become overwhelming and prone to errors.
  - What I Learned:  I learned several valuable skills, particularly in SQL and database management. Key takeaways include:SQL Proficiency: I significantly improved my understanding of SQL, including writing complex queries to manage and retrieve data across multiple related tables. I learned how to efficiently use commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE to manipulate employee, department, and role data in a relational database.Database Design: I gained hands-on experience in designing relational databases, creating tables with appropriate relationships (such as foreign keys), and ensuring data integrity. This process deepened my understanding of how databases interact with one another and how to maintain structured, scalable data storage.Command-Line Interfaces (CLI): I improved my ability to build user-friendly CLI applications. Designing an interface where users can easily navigate and interact with the database via a series of prompts gave me a deeper understanding of user experience and usability.Problem-Solving and Debugging: Throughout the project, I honed my problem-solving skills, particularly when troubleshooting SQL queries or ensuring data consistency. I also worked on refining my debugging approach, making sure the system operated smoothly by isolating and resolving issues.Project Management: I learned the importance of breaking down a larger project into manageable tasks and following through with a structured approach to ensure progress. This helped me develop better time management and organization skills for future projects.
